#React Starter Kit

Yet another React Starter Kit. It includes

- Redux
- React Router
- React Forms
- Node JS backend
- Mongo Db
- Token based authentication
- Kharma plugged in (but no tets)

It's tailored to fit my needs, but feel free to use in any way you want if you like it. Or clone and improve of course.

To get going
```
$ npm install
$ mongod
$ npm run dev
```

And to run the excellent test:
```
$ npm test
```
