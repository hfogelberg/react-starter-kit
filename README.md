#React Starter Kit

Yet another React Starter Kit. It includes

- Redux
- React Router
- React Forms
- Node JS backend
- Mongo Db integration
- Bootstrap
- Token based authentication
- Kharma plugged in (but no tests)

##To Do
- Clean up and make more DRY
- Run under HTTPS
- Improve Webpack with deployment script

It's tailored to fit my needs, but feel free to use in any way you want if you like it. Or clone and improve of course.

To get going
```
$ npm install --g nodemon
$ git clone https://github.com/hfogelberg/react-starter-kit
$ npm install
$ mongod
$ npm run dev
```

If you try to submit something to the database it will end up in the hellos collection in the test Db.

And to run the excellent test:
```
$ npm test
```
